This project is composed of 4 sub-projects:

	1. MyProxy which is the (web proxy service), it's going to store in its cache for a certain amount of time the requests to the api JCDecaux.
	2. RoutingWithBikes which is going to get all JCDecaux's stations and then use that list to compute the path from starting address to destination address. By interogating the status of the closest station to address of start(or end) int the sorted list of stations.
	3. HeavyClient which is going to do the sale thing as the light-client except there wont be a map, but it will print the instructions in the console.
	4. light-client which is going to be used by users to input their start and end itinerary and display the result inside a leaflet map.

The project contins also hosted service so that you don't need to make any furthur configurations. Just go to HostedServiceProxy\bin\Debug and execute HostedServiceProxy.exe in adminstrative mode. (Same for HostedServiceRoutingWithBikes). You must execute both hosted services.

Once your both terminals are executed just open index.html file in your favourite browser, you can find it inside the light-client folder and then input your start and destination addresses and hit the "get path" button.

You should wait a little bit (like 15 seconde, yes it's very long Lol ^^) and enjoy the displayed map in leaflet ;)

To make a new research, you must refresh the page

To test the REST API of Routing with bikes service, with postman (or inside the navigator), please copy/paste the following link in your browser (or postman, assuming you've already stared the hosted services, as exolained previously) : 
http://localhost:8733/Design_Time_Addresses/RoutingWithBikes/RESTBikeRoutingService/computeRoute?addressOfStart=4%20rue%20du%20sauveur%2069007%20lyon&addressOfDest=28%20Rue%20des%20Heros%20marseille

see the project on github : https://github.com/FRANCISAnas/eiin839/tree/benjaminvella-main/projet

An example of input : 

	Address of start : 4 rue du sauveur 69007 lyon
	Address of destiniation : 28 Rue des Heros marseille

If you want to open this project in visula studio 2019 IDE. You must launch visual studio 2019 in adminstrative mode. And, select "open a project or solution". Then go to RoutingWithBikes folder and select "RoutingWithBikes.sln" and then hit ok.

You should do the same procedure to open MyProxy project.

Finally, to open HeavyClient project, you don't need to open visual studio 2019 in adminstrative mode.
